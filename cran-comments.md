## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* Dropped the VignetteBuilder field.
* Verified that the possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION (Dufour, econometrics, and asymptotics) are not mis-spelled.

## Test environments
* local Ubuntu 18.04.02 LTS install, R 3.5.3
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
